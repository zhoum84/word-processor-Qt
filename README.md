# QWord-Processor
This is a word processor akin to a basic version of Microsoft Word, built with a QML frontend and Qt/C++ backend. 
This is still in development, so new features are being developed.

# Features
- Cross-platform rich text editing with image support
  - Bold, underline, strikethrough, bullet points, alignment, etc.
  - Change and resize fonts
  - Open links
  - Page and word count
- Open and save .html, .txt, and .md files
- Spellcheck: Find and locate text that does not match any words in a dictionary file and mark them
- Find and highlight queries (similar to Google Docs)
